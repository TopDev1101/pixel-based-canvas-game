So sick and tired of these hoes
waiting for the day and I pray they go gost
had it been a safe one with love in her clothes
but her lies of love was a tug at my pulse

yeah
so sick and tired of these hoes
leave me drowning in a brun, overdosed
only last summer was the rose overturned
to the last minute when she left me comatose

having fun
having laughs
was it all pretending?
If you didn't want me, shoulda said in the beginning.
