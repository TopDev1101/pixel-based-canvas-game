Progress log 2

Today I
* Woke up to some a MIT OCW lecture where the instructor made a point about efficency, how sometimes it's necessary to create binaries for performance.
* Watched a Louis Rossmann video about self pity and evny
* Helped my mom use the pressure cooker
* Created a checkpoint Ambitious_Dwarf0.1.2
* Created CoordinateVector container for disambiguation of usage for vectors
* Created Chunk.getGlobalTilePosition which returns the global coordinate for a given tile within a chunk
* Omitted TILES for Townsend.Tiles
* Got batch rendering to "Work". It renders it, now comes the issue of weather or not pixels get clipped.
* Got the batching canvases to resize appropriately for new chunks that are out of bounds
* Created a batching restore protocol so my computer's hard work doesn't go to waste every time a new chunk is added
* I broke the batching thing... It doesn't copy the old renders

Realizations
* I look a lot cuter with my hair swiped to the left

Problems
- The whole thing I wrote yesterday about that weird bug with the snapping
	[ ] Create a watcher the snippet
	[ ] ...
	[ ] Diagnose problem
- It could also be that the calculated tile under the cursor is coorect and that it's rendered improperly
	[x] Look for any possible problems with rendering calculation
	- There's something wrong with the TileDrawPacket.to calculation
	- There might be something wrong with Math.mod
	- AHHHH This is so frustrating...
	
Thoughts
- There's someone in the world that thinks I'm attractive. That makes me happy :>
- Scratch that, it's a trap. I feel like shit again

I feel
	- Empty
* Burdened
	- With this stupid fucking foodstamp form that I have to fill out or else we fucking starve...
