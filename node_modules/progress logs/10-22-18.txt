Today I
* Thought about grass
* ^ And negative space pixel art to draw the grass without actually drawing the grass
* Thought about animation class and the lessons on stretch and squeeze
* Exparamented with dynamic sprites by making the grass sprite seem like it was flowing based on an equation
* Added a makeshift feature to move the map using right click
* Added, albiet broken, method to the flexable Vector class to assign new values which I don't think works
* Mostly exparamented with stuff.
* Created a cache within Townsend.viewContext.cursor for event objects, named (ambiguously) events

Problems I faced
* I noticed when changing Townsend.viewContext.pixelOffset, using the new map move feature, that the rendered map /clicked/ around any zero coordinate
	- There is also the issue of when the pixelOffset has coordinates anything other than (0,0) that the tile of which the cursor was calculated to be on was wrong, off by 1
		- I remembered back to when I was refactoring the code to determine which tile the cursor was hovering over
			- At the end of the calculation pipeline was a snippet which was simply "(coordinate - 1)" which I removed during the refactor because it caused the tile the cursor was hovering over to be miscalculatd
			  giving me the tile (x+1, y+1) instead of the tile (x, y).
			- This was an underlying issue with the tile-under-cursor location that was hidden because the pixelOffset was never changed from (0,0)
		- So what makes 0,0 so special?
	- It could be something with this snippet under TiledCursorInteractionContext.prototype.handle_elementHover
	
		[...]
		.subtract( pixelOffset.add( self.viewContext.tileScaleHelper.cursorCorrection ) )			// Translate view-space pixel coordinates to tile-space pixel coordinates
		[...]

I feel
* Guilty
	- About not going to school on monday. I'm about ready to give up on college. It's not for me. I can't stand the burden of getting up in the morning
	  to go to a place I don't want to be in.
	- About not being able to live up to my family's expectations for me graduating from college.
	- About not doing my homework to protest my hate for people telling me what to do.
	- About lying to my mom to not have to go to classes today.
* Scared
	- Not knowing where I'll be in 10 years.
	- Not knowing if i'll still be able to live in this house next years
	- About not having a job.
* Burdened
	- With expectations I never asked for. Programming is the only thing I know how to do. Learning on my own terms is the only thing I know how to do. But you don't exactly get a degree from
	  learning on your own terms
* Care-free
	- My mom walked in on me asking for my help taking the laundry to the car and she saw me writing this which she assumed was work for my college courses. I've gained a bit of her trust
	  in my lie and I feel slightly less burdened by it.

	  
Thoughts
	- I've heard a couple times that employers don't care, sure it looks good, but they don't care about your degree. What do they care about? The quality of your work? Maybe I should just improve my work.
	- Louis Rossmann is my role model. He's teaching me things I would have never figured out myself.
	- I don't like groups of people. They give me anxiety. Usually groups of people are where you go to hide but I feel like a cactus in the center of a prairie. Like I'm very out of place. I don't belong.
	
Todo
	- Batch rendering
	- change Townsend.viewContext.cursor to Townsend.viewContext.mouseHandler or something more appropriate than cursor.
